# Expense Tracker

This project is a Python-based Expense Tracker application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It allows users to manage their expenses by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records. Additionally, it provides features like generating a pie chart report of expenses and customizing categories for better tracking.

## Features

1. **Add Expense**: Add details such as date, category, amount, and description.
2. **View Expenses**: Display expenses in a table format.
3. **Update and Delete**: Modify or remove existing expense entries.
4. **Custom Categories**: Add personalized categories for tracking expenses.
5. **Pie Chart Report**: Generate a graphical representation of expense distribution.
6. **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive GUI for seamless interaction.
